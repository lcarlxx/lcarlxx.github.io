            Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is a series of American superhero films produced by Marvel Studios based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. The phase began in 2016 with the release of Captain America: Civil War and concluded in 2019 with the release of Spider-Man: Far From Home. It includes the crossover films Avengers: Infinity War, released in 2018, and its sequel Avengers: Endgame, released in 2019. Kevin Feige produced every film in the phase, alongside Amy Pascal for Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home, and Stephen Broussard for Ant-Man and the Wasp. The eleven films of the phase grossed over $13.5 billion at the global box office and received generally positive critical and public response. Upon release, Avengers: Endgame became the highest-grossing film of all time.[a]

            On October 28, 2014, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced the full slate of films that the studio planned to release as part of Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU): Captain America: Civil War (2016), Doctor Strange (2016), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Black Panther (2018), Captain Marvel (2018), and Inhumans (2018), as well as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1 (2018) and Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2 (2019). Feige made this announcement at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood,[2] in an event that drew comparisons to Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference.[3] Feige explained that the studio had wanted to announce all of the titles at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, but "things were not set" for the slate at that point, so the one-off event was used instead once all of the films could be confirmed. Marvel Studios had never done a solo event such as this before, and Feige had anticipated that it would occur in early August or mid-September before the October date was settled on.[4]
            Following the Sony Pictures hack in 2014, it was revealed that Sony and Marvel were having conversations about potentially sharing Spider-Man. Marvel wanted to introduce a new version of Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War and then continue working with the Avengers in the future, while allowing Sony to keep creative control and use him in their own potential Spider-Man movies and spin-offs, with the potential of possibly using some of Marvel's characters. On February 9, 2015, Marvel made a post on their official website announcing a deal with Sony Pictures to allow Spider-Man to appear in the MCU.[5][6] In June, Tom Holland was revealed to have been cast as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, and was set to appear in Civil War as well as the next Sony Spider-Man film, which would go on to be Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).[7][8] The addition of Homecoming as well as Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) to the Phase Three slate led to date changes for Ragnarok (later in 2017), Black Panther (2018), and Captain Marvel (2019). Inhumans was removed from the release schedule, though it was not outright canceled.[9] In November 2016, Feige said that "Inhumans will happen for sure. I don't know when. I think it's happening on television. And I think as we get into Phase 4 as I've always said, it could happen as a movie."[10] Shortly after, Marvel Television and IMAX Corporation announced the eight-episode television series Inhumans, to be produced with ABC Studios and air on ABC;[11][12] Marvel Studios decided that the characters were better suited to television, rather than trying to fit multiple potential Inhumans franchise films around the studio's existing film slate.[13] The Inhumans series was not intended to be a reworking of the planned film.[11]
            In July 2016, Avengers: Infinity War Part 1 was retitled Avengers: Infinity War,[14] while Part 2 was left untitled until the release of the first teaser trailer on December 7, 2018, when it was revealed to be Avengers: Endgame. After the title was revealed, Feige stated that withholding it for so long had backfired on the studio due to the high expectations that fans had set for the reveal. Despite this, Feige stood by the decision due to how the reveal of Infinity War and Endgame before Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) was released had taken away attention from that film.[15] Civil War, Infinity War, and Endgame were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. There was a large amount of collaboration between them and the other Phase Three directors and writers to make sure "everything line[d] up right" for the MCU's "culmination" in Infinity War and Endgame.[16] Peyton Reed, director of Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp, felt the relationship and collaboration between the Phase Three directors was "probably the closest thing that this generation will have to a '30s- or '40s-era studio system where you are all on the lot and you are all working on different things."[17]
