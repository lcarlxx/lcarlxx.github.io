            Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is a series of American superhero films produced by Marvel Studios based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. The phase began in 2013 with the release of Iron Man 3 and concluded in 2015 with the release of Ant-Man. It includes the crossover film Avengers: Age of Ultron, also released in 2015. Kevin Feige produced every film in the phase. The six films of the phase grossed over $5.2 billion at the global box office and received generally positive critical and public response.
            Chris Evans appeared the most in the phase, starring or making cameo appearances in four of the Phase Two films. Marvel Studios created two more short films for their Marvel One-Shots program to expand the MCU, while each of the feature films received tie-in comic books. Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier also received video game tie-ins, while Lego Marvel's Avengers was also released, which adapted the storyline of multiple films of the franchise. Phase Two, along with Phase One and Phase Three, make up The Infinity Saga.

            Following the release of Iron Man 2 (2010), the timing and distribution arrangement of a possible third Iron Man film was brought into question following a conflict between Paramount Pictures, the distributor of previous Marvel Studios films including the first two Iron Man films, and The Walt Disney Company, Marvel Entertainment's then-new corporate parent.[1] On October 18, 2010, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3 (2013). The next October, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said the studio was beginning to look at the films of the second "phase" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which would start with Iron Man 3 and culminate in a sequel to The Avengers (2012).[3] Feige announced the full slate of Phase Two films at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2012: Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World (2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).In January 2013, Feige stated that Ant-Man (2015) would be the beginning of Phase Three,but later revealed that this had changed and Ant-Man would actually be the final film of Phase Two.
            In August 2012, Marvel signed Joss Whedon to an exclusive contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon would "contribute creatively" on Phase Two of the MCU and develop the first television series set in the universe. In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying he would "read the scripts and watch cuts and talk to the directors and writers and give my opinion", while also writing material if needed.[8] Once the story for Avengers: Age of Ultron was approved, Whedon and Marvel Studios were able to examine the other films of the Phase to "really lay it out" so things could be adjusted between the films. Despite this, Whedon did not want to be beholden to the other films of Phase Two because he wanted people to be able to watch Age of Ultron who had not seen the other MCU films since The Avengers. He also found working in television and script doctoring to be "great training ground[s] for dealing with this ... because you're giiven a bunch of pieces and told to make them fitâ€”even if they don't."
            A new Marvel Studios logo was created by Imaginary Forces for Thor: The Dark World, featuring a fanfare composed by The Dark World composer Brian Tyler. Feige explained that a new logo was commissioned for The Dark World since it was the first Marvel Studios film to not also have a distributor logo due to the studio's acquisition by Disney.
