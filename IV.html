        <p>Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is a group of American superhero films and television series produced by Marvel Studios based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. Phase Four features all of the Marvel Studios productions released from 2021 through 2022. It is the first phase in the franchise to include television series, alongside television specials marketed as "Marvel Studios Special Presentations", with Marvel Studios developing several event series for the streaming service Disney+ in addition to the feature films that it was already set to produce. Phase Four began with the series WandaVision, which premiered in January 2021, while the first theatrical film in this phase is Black Widow, which was released in July 2021 by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The phase concluded with the television special The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special in November 2022. The release schedule of Phase Four was changed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kevin Feige produces every film and executive produces every series and special in this phase, alongside producers Jonathan Schwartz for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Nate Moore for Eternals and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Amy Pascal for Spider-Man: No Way Home, and Brad Winderbaum for Thor: Love and Thunder</p>
        <p>In July 2019, Marvel Studios held a panel at San Diego Comic-Con where Feige announced the full Phase Four slate. This included five films to be released—Black Widow, Eternals, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and Thor: Love and Thunder—as well as five event series to be released on Disney+—The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, WandaVision, Loki, What If...?, and Hawkeye.[12] He confirmed that there would be connections between the films and series,[13] with the events of WandaVision directly setting up Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Loki tying into it.[14][15] Feige stated that these ten projects were the full Phase Four slate at that point, despite Marvel already developing further projects at that time,[16] such as the long-in-development Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,[17] sequels to Black Panther (2018) and Captain Marvel (2019),[18][19] and a film based on the Fantastic Four.[20] Feige also noted that the studio had films scheduled to be released after 2021 which would not be officially announced or given release dates at that time.[21] A month later at D23, Feige announced three more Disney+ series that would be released as part of the Phase Four slate: Ms. Marvel, Moon Knight,[22] and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,[22][23] as well as the Black Panther sequel with the placeholder title Black Panther II and a May 6, 2022, release.[24] In September, Disney and Sony Pictures announced that Marvel Studios and Feige would return to produce Spider-Man: No Way Home, set for release during this phase.[25][26]
            Black Widow was removed from Disney's release schedule in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[27] Discussing this decision for Variety, Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing Black Widow's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline.[28] In April, Disney changed its entire Phase Four release slate, scheduling Black Widow when Eternals had been set for release in November 2020 and moving all its other Phase Four films back in the schedule to accommodate this.[29] Later that month, Sony delayed Spider-Man: No Way Home to November 2021, resulting in Disney adjusting the release of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Thor: Love and Thunder.[30] In July 2020, Disney confirmed that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier would not release in August 2020 as planned, because the series had not completed filming due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[31] while Sony pushed back the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home to December 2021.[32] In early September, WandaVision was set to be the first television series released for the phase as The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's release was pushed back to 2021 due to its production delays.[33][34] Later that month, Black Widow's release was delayed to May 2021, resulting in Eternals and Shang-Chi and the Legends of the Ten Rings also being rescheduled;[35] this made 2020 the first year since 2009 without a Marvel Studios release.[36] When adjusting the release of the films and series in the phase, Marvel Studios was being cognizant to ensure major story points would not be spoiled with the new release order,[14] but Feige noted many of the properties in the Phase were mostly standalone or a continuation from Endgame.[37] He also credited the studio's "long lead plan" for being able to avoid any creative shifts to their Phase Four plans because of the pandemic, only shuffling release dates and production schedules.[38] Additionally, he stated that many of the series had their release dates shifted only "by a matter of weeks" from their original dates.[39] The only significant aspect of the phase that was affected by the pandemic was Julia Louis-Dreyfus's introduction as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, which came in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier rather than Black Widow as was originally planned, since Black Widow ended up being released after the series.[40][41]
            In December 2020, Marvel Studios adjusted Thor: Love and Thunder and Black Panther II back in its schedule, to May 6 and July 8, 2022, respectively,[42][43] and also announced Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Fantastic Four were in development,[44][45][46] along with the Disney+ series Secret Invasion, Ironheart,[47] and Armor Wars (later changed to a film),[47][48] The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special, and the series of short films I Am Groot.[49][50] These new Disney+ series, plus Black Panther II, Captain Marvel 2 (later retitled The Marvels), Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and Fantastic Four, were believed to be a part of Phase Four at this time.[51] In March 2021, Disney moved Black Widow to July 2021 (taking the spot of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings), and announced that it would release simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings was moved to September 2021, with the intent for a theatrical-only release.[52] In May, Marvel Studios announced the title for the Black Panther sequel as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.[53] Feige described the phase as being about "continuing in new ways and... leaving the Infinity Saga behind [for] a new beginning".[54] By August 2021, a Halloween-themed television special for Disney+ was in development, reportedly centered on Werewolf by Night.[55] In October 2021, Marvel Studios further adjusted Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Thor: Love and Thunder, and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever to May 6, July 8, and November 11, 2022, respectively,[56] because of production-related issues.
            In late June 2022, Feige indicated that Phase Four was nearing its conclusion, stating audiences would begin to see where the next saga of the MCU would be heading, and that there had been many clues in the phase to what that would be. He said Marvel Studios would be a "little more direct" on their future plans in the following months to provide audiences with "the bigger picture [so they] can see a tiny, tiny bit more of the roadmap".[58] At Marvel Studios' San Diego Comic-Con panel in July, Feige announced that Wakanda Forever would conclude Phase Four, with other films and Disney+ series believed to be part of the phase moving to Phase Five and Phase Six. He also announced that Phase Four would be the first phase, along with Phases Five and Six, of The Multiverse Saga.[59] Feige stated that many of the projects in Phases Four and Five, and their post-credit teases, would connect and lead towards the conclusion of The Multiverse Saga, while some would remain standalone.[60] James Gunn, the writer and director of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, said that The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special was the epilogue of Phase Four.[61] At the 2022 D23 Expo, Marvel confirmed the Halloween special as Werewolf by Night.[62] At that time, Werewolf by Night and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special were revealed to be marketed as "Marvel Studios Special Presentations".</p>
